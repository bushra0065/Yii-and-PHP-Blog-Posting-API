REQUIREMENTS
------------

    The minimum requirement by Yii is that your Web server supports
    PHP 5.1.0 or above. Yii has been tested with Apache HTTP server
    on Windows and Linux operating systems.

    Please access the following URL to check if your Web server reaches
    the requirements by Yii, assuming "YiiPath" is where Yii is installed:
